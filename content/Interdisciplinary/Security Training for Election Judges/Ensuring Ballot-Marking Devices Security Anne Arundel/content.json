However, because potential election day infiltration has continued to become an issue throughout recent years, it is important to ensure that election judges are aware of the potential threats, and how to prevent them from happening. The ballot marking device plays an essential role during election day because it provides voters with another option to mark their ballots independently. Each designated precinct receives a minimum of one ballot marking device, and it is the responsibility of the election judges to set up and monitor the equipment under the supervision of the chief judges. It is also the chief judge’s responsibility to ensure there are five (5) ballots cast from the ballot marking device by 1:00 PM."

Submitting an audio ballot is an alternative extended to those using the ballot marking device; all accessibility features are still available with this option. The settings on the device can also be adjusted to offer high-contrast and enlarged print viewing options. It is important to note that the ballot marking device does NOT actually record votes; the voter’s ballot activation card gets inserted into the scanning unit, which then marks their selections."
