With cyber threats evolving in complexity and frequency, organizations across industries such as healthcare, national security, ecommerce, and others are grappling with the challenge of safeguarding digital assets. A 2023 report by Cybersecurity Ventures projected that by 2025, the global cost of cybercrime will reach $10.5 trillion annually [1]. Moreover, the workforce gap in cybersecurity is widening, according to cyberseek.org there are over 663,000 cybersecurity job openings in the United States in 2023 [2]. This deficit in skilled professionals leaves businesses vulnerable to data breaches, ransomware attacks, social engineering and other malicious activities. Addressing this gap requires collaborative and interdisciplinary efforts from governments, academia, and industry in order to address the threats of the modern cyber landscape. "

It established a common lexicon that describes cybersecurity work and workers regardless of who they might work for in public, private, and/or academic sectors. Students and working professionals can use this framework to identify potential work roles they might want to do or are currently doing. Work roles are detailed groupings of cybersecurity and related work which include a list of the knowledge, skills, and tasks that are necessary in order to perform that role. Knowledge and skills can be obtained through course work, extra curricular activities, certifications, internships, research projects, or personal projects."
