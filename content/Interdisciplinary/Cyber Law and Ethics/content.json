Trade secrets are confidential corporate data that is not protected by copyright or patent laws and that the company has taken measures to protect due to having economic value. An example is the recipe for Coca-Cola, they have not filed a patent because that would require the recipe to be made public which could result in a competitor creating a duplicate."
