These three considerations are the <strong>CAT model: Confidentiality</strong> (How private your posts are), <strong>Availability</strong> (How long your posts are accessible), and <strong>Trust</strong> (who you're trusting with your posts). Posting carelessly without taking these issues into consideration can be a risky practice that can lead to trouble for you now or down the road in your career."
