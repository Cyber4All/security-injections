It is known as e-Government and comprises the entire range of collaborative work and information sharing as used by businesses. Although government work has the responsibility of transparency and accountability to oversight agencies, conditions of confidentiality and security is required for much of the internal communication and collaboration. Cybersecurity violations can expose vital information and can potentially have grave consequences in the government's ability to function with friendly or less-than-friendly governments."

For a government department or agency to function effectively, staff members at all levels need to share documents, information, and messages, with staff members in other departments or agencies, or with corporations as contractors. The Intranet or internal network of the agency is the same TCP/IP protocol environment as the general Internet, and is subject to the same security threats unless strict security protocols are used. Thus government documents become vulnerable to hacking and penetration by other governments, or even covert agencies supported by other governments, unless measures are taken that may include intrusion prevention and encryption."

Thus, it is common to expect that foreign governments or their agencies may seek to penetrate the network and extract information for their own advantages. It should also be noted that these threats to cybersecurity often have more resources than ordinary businesses and less liability under international law."
