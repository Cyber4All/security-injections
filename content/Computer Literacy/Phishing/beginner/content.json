The second is to give firsthand experience to users through games, simulated phish, cartoons, etc. Recent studies seem to indicate that the latter—giving firsthand experience to users—might be more effective. The game, Anti-Phishing Phil (see picture), which teaches people how to identify suspicious website addresses while providing the experience of being captured by a phisher, is such an example. PhishGuru in the previous section is another example. It delivers cartoon-based, anti-phishing information after a user has been deceived by simulated phishing messages."

One of the techniques used to automatically identify phish is <strong>filtering</strong>. The objective of filtering is to identify (or flag) phishing attempts in e-mail or on webpages. Filters are usually integrated into browsers or e-mail software. When a web address is encountered the software compares it with a so-called \"blacklist\" of known phishing websites. It then takes appropriate actions, which usually include informing the user. The blacklist is updated periodically (for example, every 30 minutes) as new phishing sites become available. As with any blacklist, there is also a \"whitelist\" of known legitimate sites."
