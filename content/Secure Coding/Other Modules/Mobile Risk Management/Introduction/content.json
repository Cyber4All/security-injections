Significant amounts of personal data, financial data, and enterprise data are being carried around on these devices which are increasingly prone to data loss through both theft and software-based attack. Hence, ensuring and maintaining mobile security is of vital importance to secure operation and management of such systems. To achieve these objectives, organizations must meet the growing trend of mobile platforms with greater security measures to support critical business functions and protect sensitive data on these devices. Mobile architectures and/or applications must be developed and managed in compliance with up-to-date federal guidelines and standards. The federally directed NIST risk management framework is depicted in the figure below. The framework lays the foundation for risk assessment of data access, storage and transmission for a typical distributed information system. The steps are discussed below."
