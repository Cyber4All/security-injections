Untyped languages such as Perl and Ruby do not have any such requirements – any variable can store any type of value. Of course, these languages do not eliminate validation problems – you may still run into trouble if you use a string to retrieve an item from an integer- indexed array. Some languages provide additional help in the form of built-in procedures that can be used to remove potentially damaging characters from input strings."
