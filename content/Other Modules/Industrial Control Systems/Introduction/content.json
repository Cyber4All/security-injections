An operator would have visible and physical access to a discreet number of physical systems making comprehensive situational awareness impossible without cooperation and accurate information from other parties.  Centralized management provided these same controls and services in one location, but in the form of direct physical access – think levers, switches, and knobs.  The attack vectors are limited in a centralized direct access system including physical attack and malfunction from both non- and nefarious actors.  However, these systems were highly inflexible.  Change due to an addition or modification would require the facilities to be modified since the systems were hard-wired.  Advances in technology allowed computers to manage the systems more efficiently, effectively, and productively than humans.  The modern approach to ICS using sensors, networks, and software management is called DCS (Distributed Computing Systems). DCS is a generic term as each implementation is customized to the situation.  In DCS systems, PLC’s (Programmable Logic Controllers) have replaced the manual switches, levers, and valves found in the earliest ICS systems.  Originally found in the automotive industry, DCS has evolved to become intertwined with SCADA.  SCADA uses RTU (remote terminal units) instead of PLC’s – often to accomplish similar objectives of supervising existing units.   SCADA and DCS are control systems for decentralized management.  The transition to decentralized management and embedded systems has created a larger attack surface."

The Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) (<a href = http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/Main_Page> www.pentest-standard.org</a>) provides a framework for identifying potential security vulnerabilities.  PTES includes intelligence gathering, threat modeling, and vulnerability analysis.  Intelligence gathering, arguably the most important aspect of vulnerability detection, requires the administration to learn the behaviors, operations, and existing attack vectors while identifying existing protection methods.  Intelligence gathering occurs passively and actively.  Passive intelligence discovers information about targets without touching the systems such as recording instrument telemetry that could identify communicating controls.  Active intelligence directly interacts with the system such as transmitting information and assessing changes in feedback controls."

Threat modeling also includes threat capability analysis and motivation modeling based on the specific infrastructure.  After gathering intelligence and threat modeling, vulnerability analysis starts.  Vulnerability analysis is the process of discovering flaws in the system.  The process can be done manually or through automation tools through active and passive scanning.  Further analysis may include exploitation may occur in a controlled fashion to gather more information only if the rules of engagement include such action."
