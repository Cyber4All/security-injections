This value is the largest number that can fit in a 32 bit unsigned integer. If the number of members of the group exceeded this number, it might cause an overflow. Whether it will cause an overflow or not depends upon how Facebook is implemented and which language is used â€“ they might use data types that can hold larger numbers. In any case, the chances of an overflow seem remote, as roughly 2/3 of the people on earth would be required to reach the goal of more than 4 billion members.","On December 25, 2004, Comair airlines was forced to ground 1,100 flights after its flight crew scheduling software crashed. The software used a 16-bit integer (max 32,768) to store the number of crew changes. That number was exceeded due to bad weather that month which led to numerous crew reassignments."],"ordered":true},{"type":"question","id":"memory","prompt":"Declaring a variable as type integer:","ignored":false,"mode":"radio","choices":[{"id":"infinite","text":"allocates an infinite amount of storage"},{"id":"fixed","text":"allocates a fixed amount of storage"}],"answer":"fixed"},{"type":"question","id":"effect","prompt":"An integer error in C++ causes:","ignored":false,"mode":"radio","choices":[{"id":"syntax","text":"a syntax error"},{"id":"correction","text":"the program to correct itself"},{"id":"unexpected","text":"unexpected behavior"}],"answer":"unexpected"}]}]}
