Hackers can use attacks, such as brute force (which is a type of attack that relies purely on trial and error) and dictionary attacks (that attempt to crack a password by testing it against a list of dictionary words) to guess your password and use this information to commit illegal or undesirable acts in your name."},{"type":"subheader","text":"Risk - How can it happen?"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"When you use an easily guessed password, such as your user ID, any name, or a word from the dictionary; your password becomes an easy target for brute force and dictionary attacks.

When “he checked the results Monday morning at around 11:00 a.m. E.T., he found he was in Crystal's account.” GMZ soon realized that Crystal was actually a Twitter staffer with administrative privileges. He was able to compromise several high-profile accounts by resetting their passwords and making them available to fellow hackers. Some of these included the accounts of President Elect Barack Obama, Britney Spears, CBS News and Fox News."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Weak Password Brings 'Happiness' to Twitter Hacker http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2009/01/professed-twitt.html"},{"type":"subheader","text":"Answer the following questions"},{"type":"question","id":"passwordproblems","prompt":"Which of the following holds true for “problems with passwords”?","ignored":false,"mode":"checkbox","choices":[{"id":"troubleremembering","text":"People have trouble remembering strong passwords","ans":true},{"id":"easytoguess","text":"The passwords people can remember tend to be easy to guess","ans":true},{"id":"easyremembering","text":"People can easily remember strong passwords","ans":false},{"id":"difficulttoguess","text":"The passwords people can remember tend to be difficult to guess","ans":false}]},{"type":"question","id":"hacker","prompt":"Which of the following attacks can a hacker use to guess a password?","ignored":false,"mode":"checkbox","choices":[{"id":"brute","text":"Brute force","ans":true},{"id":"dict","text":"Dictionary","ans":true}]},{"type":"question","id":"bruteattack","prompt":"Which of the following applies to a brute force attack?","ignored":false,"mode":"radio","choices":[{"id":"trialerror","text":"It relies purely on trial and error to guess a password"},{"id":"listofdict","text":"It attempts to crack a password by testing it against a list of dictionary words"}],"answer":"trialerror"},{"type":"question","id":"dictattack","prompt":"Which of the following applies to a dictionary attack?","ignored":false,"mode":"radio","choices":[{"id":"trialerror","text":"It relies purely on trial and error to guess a password"},{"id":"listofdict","text":"It attempts to crack a password by testing it against a list of dictionary words"}],"answer":"listofdict"}]},{"header":"Password Responsibly","units":[{"type":"subheader","text":"How can I avoid an Integer Error?"},{"type":"list","items":["<em>Know your limits:</em> Familiarize yourself with the ranges available for each data type.
