A Security Injection is a self-contained learning module that organizations and educators can use to teach students or trainees about a new skill or concept. Security Injections were created by Dr. Blair Taylor of Towson University, who named them so because their purpose is to make it easy for educators to inject secure coding principles into their Computer Science courses. Since their creation in 2008, they have been utilized by more than 200 institutions to teach a variety of subjects.

A Security Injection typically looks like a webpage with a background section, multiple choice questions, short-answer questions, lab assignment(s), and a completion certificate. Note that they are used for teaching purposes only, and not for testing or grading. To try a Security Injection yourself, please visit [this link](https://cisserv1.towson.edu/~cssecinj/).
